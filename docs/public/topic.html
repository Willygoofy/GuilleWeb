                <p class="SW"style="background: none;">Ahsoka Tano has had one of the biggest character arcs in all of Star Wars, both in-universe and out of it. 
                  First introduced in The Clone Wars movie, the previously unnamed Padawan of Anakin has become not only one of the most complex and essential characters 
                  in the franchise but one of the most beloved, to the point where she not only survived Order 66, but became an important part of Rebels and even had a voice 
                  appearance in The Rise of Skywalker prior to a live-action debut in season two of The Mandalorian. Now she’s the first animated Star Wars character to lead their own live-action show, 
                  with Rosario Dawson stepping into the title role, and Dave Filoni, who co-created the character with George Lucas, at the helm to navigate 15 years’ worth of backstory and character development.</p>
